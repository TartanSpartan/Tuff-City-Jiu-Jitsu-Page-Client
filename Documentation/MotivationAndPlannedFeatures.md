# Motivation and Planned Features

This project was my final piece of coursework for the CodeCore College Web Development Bootcamp, due mid-June, 2021. I am now the lead instructor for the Shorinji Kan Jiu Jitsu club (affiliated with Jitsu Canada) in the small community of Tofino, BC. I hope to develop a career as a web developer and apply my skills to create a useful resource for students of the club. The primary, longstanding motivation was to help serve as a bridge for instructors and other jitsuka transitioning between different countries which host Shorinji Kan clubs, along with other goals in the fullness of time. They are summarized as follows:

• Provide a resource for "translating" between the UK and Canadian versions of the martial art's syllabus, which largely overlap, but with some significant differences, of which many are poorly understood by students and instructors alike. Aiming to achieve the universal standard of "if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a million" with side-by-side multimedia comparisons

• A semantic tree map to visualise the different categories of syllabus techniques, as a memory-aid and to achieve deeper understanding

• A clear and compelling recruitment tool with the joint aims of empowering the local community, to provide solidarity and strength in numbers, and to foster a welcoming and fun social scene

• Incorporate a members section with content appropriately tailored according to the user's current belt grade and the next grade/qualifications they are working towards; eventually this might become more granular with 1:1 feedback and detailed technique-by-technique breakdowns

• Supplement and interface with existing social media websites for the club

• Robust enough interface that technology-averse members with seniority can nevertheless easily take on administrator roles and tasks

• An upcoming events page, for occasions ranging from the local to the global stages, hoping to ensure participation in person or by remote conferencing

• Use mapping APIs to provide information about other Jitsu Canada clubs and also some farther afield

• Ability to track attendance and to digitise the training waiver

• Official live deployment online e.g. with the Heroku or AWS platforms
